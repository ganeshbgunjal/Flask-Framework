## Flask Framewok:-
Flask is a lightweight web framework in Python that helps you build web applications and APIs quickly.

Think of it like this:
- Python by itself can’t directly handle a browser request like “show me a webpage”.

- Flask acts as a bridge between Python and the web — it takes incoming requests (like visiting a     URL), processes them with Python code, and returns responses (like HTML pages or JSON data).

### 🔑 Key Points about Flask:

1. Lightweight & Simple – Unlike Django (which is heavier and has lots of built-in features), Flask  gives you just the basics: routing, request handling, and templates. You add only what you need.

2. Routing System – Lets you map URLs to Python functions. Example: /home → home() function.

3. Jinja2 Templates – Flask uses a template engine to create dynamic HTML pages.

4. Extensible – You can add plugins for database support, authentication, form handling, etc.

5. Great for APIs – Widely used for building REST APIs because of its simplicity.
