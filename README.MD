## Flask Framewok:-
Flask is a lightweight web framework in Python that helps you build web applications and APIs quickly.

Think of it like this:
- Python by itself can’t directly handle a browser request like “show me a webpage”.

- Flask acts as a bridge between Python and the web — it takes incoming requests (like visiting a     URL), processes them with Python code, and returns responses (like HTML pages or JSON data).
